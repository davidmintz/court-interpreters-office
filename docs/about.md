# about InterpretersOffice

<strong>What is it?</strong>

<p class="ml-4"><span class="text-monospace">InterpretersOffice</span> is a web application for managing a busy court interpreters office – for example, a U.S. District Court in the United States' federal judiciary system.</p>

<strong>What's so great about it?</strong>

<p class="ml-4">It has been developed over a number of years by a full-time staff court interpreter who is also a web developer, with input from his colleagues. With a solid basis in years of experience, it has been rigorously designed to make the administration of a high-volume court interpreters unit as pleasant and efficient as possible. We know of no other product, commercial or otherwise, that is comparable.</p>

<p class="ml-4">It has a lot of interesting features. Court personnel can post requests for interpreters, which interpreters office staff can add 
    to their schedule with a single click. <span class="text-monospace">InterpretersOffice</span>  can be configured to do things automatically in 
    response to certain events. For example, when a request for interpreting 
    services is cancelled, <span class="text-monospace">InterpretersOffice</span> can automatically remove it from the schedule and send email notification to any interpreters who have been assigned.</p>

<p class="ml-4">There's much more. Further details are available in the project's <a href="https://github.com/davidmintz/court-interpreters-office/blob/master/README.md">README file.</a></p>
