# documentation

### user guide

End user documentation has yet to be completed. We plan to record and publish some screencasts that demonstrate 
the use of <span class="text-monospace">InterpretersOffice</span>.

There is a demo installation available for you to test-drive. Please contact davidmintz@interpretersoffice.org for details.

Finally, if you are truly curious and impatient, you can have a look at the technical documentation shown below. Although 
it assumes the reader's understanding of object-oriented PHP and relational databases, non-technical readers may nonetheless 
wish to skim it to get a sense of the application's features and how it works.

### developer guide

These documents are primarily intended for system administrators and/or web developers who have adopted or are considering 
adopting <span class="text-monospace">InterpretersOffice</span>
