# documentation

### user guide

End user documentation is incomplete, but we do have a [Youtube screencast](https://youtu.be/PN2BtS7oH7A) that introduces 
and demonstrates the use of <span class="text-monospace">InterpretersOffice</span>. We recommend viewing it in full-screen 
mode on a device with a relatively large display.

There is also demo installation available for you to test-drive. Please contact davidmintz@interpretersoffice.org for details.

Finally, you can have a look at the technical documentation shown below. Although 
it assumes the reader's understanding of object-oriented PHP and relational databases, non-technical readers may nonetheless 
wish to skim it to get a sense of the application's features and how it works.
